### ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
A. Keyword Extractor Tool to HashTag Tool

Tasks:

1.  Look at the `text.txt` file and notice it is a video transcription.
2.  Run `main.py` by typing `python main.py --help`.  Notice there are two tools:  `extract` and `hashtags`
3.  Next convert the text into keywords using the `python main.py extract`.  What do you see?
4.  Now run `python main.py hashtags`.  What do you see?
5.  Next convert the command-line tool to have another flag that limits the keywords to a maximum of the top keywords (lowest score is better).
6.  Grab some text on the internet, say wikipedia or a blog post and create hashtags with it.
